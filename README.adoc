= covid-vax-tracker

Have been going back and forth on a local chat group around how to best find
available appointments to get one of the COVID vaccines.  Initially I was personally using https://github.com/Countdown369/CVS-COVID-19-Vaccine-Alerts[This python script], but I wanted something I could share.  As it is extremely apparent, I am a terrible coder and even worse with python, but this was a good opportunity to learn both python and flask a little better, I'm approaching it like that.

This is going to be an evolutionary process for me to work through how to stretch beyond my normal infrastructure focused comfort zone.

End goal would be to have it as a container I can just deploy anywhere (EKB or similar).
